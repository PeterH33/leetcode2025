# 2025 Leet Code solutions

This is a repository of my solutions for daily leetcode problems in 2025 with python (and occasionally python3 when there might be a fun method available).

I am currently a Masters student in Applied Computer Science, in many of these files I am actively learning, sometimes I provide an optimal solutions, sometimes not.

I have often returned to previous answers in my disorganized files for a problem that I remember from leetcode, and recently I discovered that my old solutions are not always available on the leetcode website. As such I am creating an organized archive here for reference. I am in the process of uploading my backlog of solutions from 2025.

Files names are in yymmdd format to make it easy to find a date.

All problem descriptions are the property of LeetCode and are reposted here for educational purposes.
