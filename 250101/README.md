## Problem
### Maximum score after splitting a string

Given a string s of zeros and ones, return the maximum score after splitting the string into two non-empty substrings (i.e. left substring and right substring).

The score after splitting a string is the number of zeros in the left substring plus the number of ones in the right substring.

## Initial impression
A New year and some easy questions!
This problem is easily solved using the .count() method and simple logic, the code can be optimzed to run slightly faster, but the code presented here is made to be readable.
